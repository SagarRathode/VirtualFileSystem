# üóÇÔ∏è Customized Virtual File System (CVFS)

A simple in-memory virtual file system written in C that simulates basic UNIX file operations using custom data structures like inodes, superblocks, and file tables.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Create, read, write, open, and delete regular files
- View file stats via `stat` and `fstat`
- Support for file permissions (read, write, read-write)
- Maintain offsets for reading/writing
- File seeking (`lseek`)
- Manual/help command descriptions

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation

To compile the CVFS project:

```bash
gcc -o cvfs main.c
```

> Replace `main.c` with the filename containing your code.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running

Run the program after compiling:

```bash
./cvfs
```

## üìÅ Example

```bash
CVFS : > create demo.txt 3
File is successfully created with file descriptor : 0

CVFS : > open demo.txt 3
File is successfully opened with file descriptor : 1

CVFS : > write demo.txt
Enter the data :
Hello Virtual File System!

CVFS : > read demo.txt 24
Hello Virtual File System!
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Maximum 50 files (MAXINODE)
- File size limited to 2048 bytes
- In-memory only, no persistent storage

## üìå Future Enhancements

- Persistent file storage on disk
- Directory support
- User authentication
- File timestamp tracking
